.
.SH "NAME"
\fBcarbon\-relay\-ng\fR \- route traffic to Graphite\'s carbon\-cache\.py
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcarbon\-relay\-ng\fR [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-l\fR [\fIip\fR]:\fIport\fR] [\fIpattern\fR]=[\fIip\fR]:\fIport\fR[\.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBcarbon\-relay\-ng\fR exists because Graphite\'s built\-in \fBcarbon\-relay\.py\fR insists on forwarding every metric it receives to the default relay, even if the metric matches one of the other patterns\.
.
.P
Each of the non\-option arguments must be of the form [\fIpattern\fR]=[\fIip\fR]:\fIport\fR, which instructs \fBcarbon\-relay\-ng\fR to forward metrics matching the regular expression \fIpattern\fR (which, when empty, trivially matches everything) to a particular Graphite native protocol service, usually a \fBcarbon\-cache\.py\fR\.
.
.P
With \fB\-f\fR, the search for relays ends at the first match, which removes the burden of designing mutually\-exclusive regular expressions from the user\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Relay only to the first matching route\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR [\fIip\fR]:\fIport\fR
Listen address (default: \fB0\.0\.0\.0:2003\fR)\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Send production and staging data to different \fBcarbon\-cache\.py\fR instances:

.nf

carbon\-relay\-ng \-f \e\e\.staging\e\e\.=1\.2\.3\.4:2003 \e\e\.production\e\e\.=5\.6\.7\.8:2003

.P
Note the use of \fB\-f\fR to relay data only to the first matching route\.

.P
Repeatedly reading the most recent data points in a Whisper file is silly\. This pattern allows alerting and event processing systems to act on the data as it is received\.
